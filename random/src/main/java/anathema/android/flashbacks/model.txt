Next we qualify that action:
Then each one has a antagonist/conflict source:

1-7: While in control of themselves.
8-10: While under the control of the curse!

Enjoyed Discovery (with) Family, While under the control of the curse!, But only through a great betrayal. - Oh dear, looks like I was researching with my family but had to betray one of them to succeeded.
